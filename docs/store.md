# Rumble! Chat

A chat window for those in your room to converse without swapping windows.  Allows for direct messaging, basic dice rolling, safety cards and also logs monster rolls from Clash.

**General Information**

No data is stored with Rumble! All chat logs will disappear if the page is refreshed or the room is reloaded.  It's meant to just be for the session (At least for now).

If you have Rumble minimized, it'll have a notification bubble to show you the amount of missed messages. This will be dismissed when it's opened. It will also be yellow if someone has whispered to you.

Safety Cards work slightly different from each other, but are all anonymous.
1. **Green Checkmark**. This is sent only to the GM and just let's them know 'someone' is happy with the way things are going.
2. **Yellow Circle**. This is sent to everyone, popping up a yellow card center screen and adding a message into the chat log to let them know someone is wary of how things are going.
3. **Red Cross**. This is also sent to everyone, like the circle. Just different messaging.
